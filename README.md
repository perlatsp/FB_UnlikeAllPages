# FB_UnlikeAllPages
 Simple script to "unlike" all facebook pages you liked.
 Created this as i wanted to unlike the pages i liked but it would take me ages to accomplish it.
 
 ## How to use
  - Copy ( CTRL + C ) contents of unlike.js
  - Visit https://facebook.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/likes_all
  - Scroll until all liked pages are displayed
  - Open Dev tools (F12 key on Google Chrome ) 
  - Navigate to console
  - Paste ( CTRL + V ) and hit enter and wait for the magic!
  - VOILA!

# How it works
It will find DOM elements based on class name and trigger click events on appropriate buttons to get the desired result.
*Facebook might change class names on these elements or structure on future updates, this script won't work then.*
**DISCLAIMER**: I am not responsible for missuse of the code or any non-desireable results you get.

# TODO

-  [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Unlike only selected pages
